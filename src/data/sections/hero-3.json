The UNSC is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions on member states. The Security Council was created after World War II to address the failings of the League of Nations in maintaining world peace. It held its first session on 17 January 1946 but was largely paralyzed in the following decades by the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union (and their allies). The Security Council consists of fifteen members, of which five are permanent: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.",
